      <h2>What is the "Required Hire" Shift?</h2>
      <p>In 2026, companies are moving away from traditional hiring filters like college degrees, years of experience, or prestigious institutions. Instead, they focus on <strong>required skills</strong> — demonstrable abilities that directly match the job's needs.</p>
      <p>This trend, often called <strong>skills-based hiring</strong>, is becoming the dominant model because:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>AI and automation are eliminating many routine entry-level tasks</li>
        <li>There's a growing <strong>skills gap</strong> in fast-evolving areas like AI, data, cloud, cybersecurity, and digital tools</li>
        <li>Companies want faster hiring, better retention, and more diverse talent pools</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Reports from 2025–2026 show that more no of employers are adopting or planning skills-first approaches, especially for entry-level and fresher roles.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="key-points">
      <h2>Why This is the Next Big Change for Freshers & Job Seekers</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Degrees are losing importance</strong><br>Many top MNC companies  have already dropped degree requirements for many roles. In 2026, this is accelerating — especially for tech, digital marketing, sales, and support positions.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Entry-level jobs are shrinking</strong><br>AI is replacing or compressing many traditional fresher roles (basic coding, data entry, admin tasks). Companies plan fewer classic "trainee" positions and more roles needing immediate usable skills.</li>
        
        <li><strong>AI literacy is the new baseline</strong><br>Basic prompt engineering, AI tool usage , and understanding AI outputs are becoming "entry-level" expectations — even for non-tech jobs.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Proof > Certificates</strong><br>Employers want portfolios, GitHub projects, freelance work, hackathon wins, certifications with projects, or skill test results instead of just resumes.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Skills-based hiring favors fast learners</strong><br>Freshers who continuously upskill (via , YouTube, CodeCamp, etc.) and can <strong>prove</strong> their abilities have a huge advantage over those relying only on academic marks.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How Freshers & Job Seekers Should Prepare in 2026</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Build a strong <strong>portfolio</strong> or GitHub — show real work, not just theory</li>
        <li>Learn in-demand skills: AI basics, Python/SQL, cloud (AWS/Azure), digital tools</li>
        <li>Take skill assessments on platforms like Rank, Code, Test</li>
        <li>Get micro-credentials & badges (Career Certificates,  SkillsBuild, etc.)</li>
        <li>Practice explaining projects using STAR method in interviews</li>
        <li>Network  — share your learning journey and small wins</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The job market is no longer "study hard → get degree → get job". It's now "learn skills → build proof → demonstrate value → get hired".</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>The recruitment world in 2026 rewards <strong>capability over credentials</strong>. For freshers and job seekers, this is both a challenge and a massive opportunity. Those who adapt quickly by focusing on real, required skills will stand out in a more selective, AI-influenced job market.</p>
      <p>Start building your skills today — the future belongs to the capable, not just the qualified.</p>
