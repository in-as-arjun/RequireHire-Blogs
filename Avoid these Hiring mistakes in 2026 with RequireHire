        <h1>7 Mistakes You're Making in Tech Hiring — And How to Avoid Them in 2026</h1>
        <div class="intro">
            <p>Tech hiring in India — especially for roles like developers, AI engineers, and IT specialists — has never been more competitive. Companies in Bihar, Patna, and across the country lose top talent daily due to common pitfalls. The good news? You can fix them fast with smarter tools like <strong>RequireHire</strong>.</p>
            <p>RequireHire is India's leading platform for verified tech talent, AI-powered matching, skill-based scoring, and streamlined interviews — helping startups and businesses hire 2x faster with 90% better fit. Here's the 7 biggest tech hiring mistakes we're seeing right now — and exactly how to dodge them.</p>
        </div>
    </header>

    <section class="mistake">
        <h3>Mistake #1: Relying on Resumes Instead of Real Skills</h3>
        <p>Resumes tell you history, not capability. Many tech candidates pad experience or fake skills, leading to bad hires that cost time and money.</p>
        <div class="solution">Solution: Switch to skills-based hiring. RequireHire uses verified profiles and skill-scoring systems so you see proven abilities first — no more resume roulette.</div>
    </section>

    <section class="mistake">
        <h3>Mistake #2: Ignoring Cultural Fit and Soft Skills</h3>
        <p>Technical chops matter, but poor communication, teamwork issues, or misaligned values destroy teams. Over-focusing on code ignores what makes teams thrive long-term.</p>
        <div class="solution">Solution: Balance tech + soft skills from day one. RequireHire's platform highlights both — plus cultural insights — so you hire people who fit and perform.</div>
    </section>

    <section class="mistake">
        <h3>Mistake #3: Slow and Complicated Hiring Processes</h3>
        <p>Long interview loops, delayed feedback, and ghosting drive top tech talent away. In 2026, great developers accept offers in under 10 days.</p>
        <div class="solution">Solution: Streamline with AI. RequireHire's fast-track interviews and automated matching cut hiring time dramatically — get quality candidates faster without chaos.</div>
    </section>

    <section class="mistake">
        <h3>Mistake #4: Unclear or Outdated Job Descriptions</h3>
        <p>Vague postings or "unicorn" requirements scare away qualified applicants or attract mismatches. Poor JDs mean flooded inboxes with irrelevant resumes.</p>
        <div class="solution">Solution: Write clear, skills-focused descriptions. RequireHire helps optimize postings and matches candidates directly to real needs — attracting the right talent instantly.</div>
    </section>

    <section class="mistake">
        <h3>Mistake #5: Overlooking Hidden Talent Pools in India</h3>
        <p>Many companies stick to metros like Bangalore or Hyderabad, missing incredible developers in emerging hubs like Bihar, Patna, and Tier-2 cities.</p>
        <div class="solution">Solution: Tap untapped talent. RequireHire connects you to verified professionals across India — including high-potential candidates from Bihar — expanding your reach without extra effort.</div>
    </section>

    <section class="mistake">
        <h3>Mistake #6: Skipping Proper Tech Assessments</h3>
        <p>Relying only on interviews or LeetCode-style tests misses real-world ability. With AI cheating rising, outdated assessments lead to false positives.</p>
        <div class="solution">Solution: Use practical, proctored assessments. RequireHire integrates skill tests and AI interviews that predict success accurately — ensuring you hire builders, not just talkers.</div>
    </section>

    <section class="mistake">
        <h3>Mistake #7: Neglecting Employer Branding & Candidate Experience</h3>
        <p>Ghosting candidates, poor communication, or weak branding makes your company look unprofessional — top talent goes to competitors who treat them better.</p>
        <div class="solution">Solution: Prioritize candidate experience. RequireHire provides transparent tracking, quick responses, and professional interactions — building your brand while filling roles faster.</div>
