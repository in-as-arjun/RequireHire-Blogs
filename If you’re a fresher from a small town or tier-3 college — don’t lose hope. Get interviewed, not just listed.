        <h1>Ravi's Real Journey: Small-Town Boy to Corporate Success</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">How a Commerce Graduate from Patna Overcame Challenges with RequireHire & Now Guides Freshers</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. The Starting Point – Humble Beginnings in Patna</h2>
            <p>I come from a small district near Patna, Bihar. Studied commerce in a tier-3 college with limited placements, old infrastructure, and very few company visits. Most classmates were either preparing for government jobs or settling for local low-paying roles.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. Major Challenges I Faced</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>No campus placements – zero big-company exposure</li>
                <li>Traditional job portals → 1000+ applications → almost zero responses</li>
                <li>Tier-3 college tag made my resume invisible to recruiters</li>
                <li>Lack of interview practice & confidence in communication</li>
                <li>Financial pressure – couldn't afford expensive coaching or courses</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. The Turning Point – Discovering RequireHire</h2>
            <p>RequireHire changed everything. Instead of uploading resumes blindly, I got interviewed first through their AI-powered pre-screening. My commerce knowledge was scored fairly, profile became <strong>anonymized + skill-verified</strong>, and real HRs started reaching out directly.</p>
            <p>Within months I cleared multiple rounds and landed a stable finance job in a reputed company – something I never imagined possible from my background.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="quote">
            “RequireHire didn’t just give me interviews — it gave me visibility, fairness, and confidence. It leveled the playing field for small-town students like me.”
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>4. Career Tips I Give to Every Fresher (Especially Commerce & Tier-3 Students)</h2>
            
            <div class="tip">
                <strong>Tip 1:</strong> Stop mass-applying on Naukri/LinkedIn. Focus on platforms that let you get interviewed first — like RequireHire.
            </div>
            
            <div class="tip">
                <strong>Tip 2:</strong> Build real skills over fancy certifications. Practice daily — even 20 minutes of AI mock interviews makes a huge difference.
            </div>
            
            <div class="tip">
                <strong>Tip 3:</strong> Never hide your college name — highlight your knowledge instead. Skill-based platforms reward what you know, not where you studied.
            </div>
            
            <div class="tip">
                <strong>Tip 4:</strong> Use free/affordable tools. RequireHire’s AI mock interviews helped me fix my answers, body language & confidence without spending a rupee.
            </div>
            
            <div class="tip">
                <strong>Tip 5:</strong> Consistency beats talent. I practiced whenever I got 15–30 minutes free — bus rides, evenings, weekends. Small efforts compound fast.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>5. Where I Am Today & My Message</h2>
            <p>Today I have a stable job, financial independence, and I’m continuously upskilling. Whenever I get free time, I log into RequireHire, take AI mock interviews, improve my weak areas, and stay interview-ready.</p>
            <p><strong>RequireHire is not just a job portal — it is the future of fair hiring.</strong> It removes bias, brings opportunities to tier-2/tier-3 cities, and lets talent speak louder than college names.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="quote" style="background:#d4edda; border-left:5px solid #27ae60;">
            “If you’re a fresher from a small town or tier-3 college — don’t lose hope. Get interviewed, not just listed. Platforms like RequireHire are built for students like us. Your opportunity is waiting — go claim it!”
